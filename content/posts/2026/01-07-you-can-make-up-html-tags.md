> Browsers handle unrecognized tags by treating them as a generic element, with no effect beyond what’s specified in the CSS. This isn’t just a weird quirk, but is standardized behavior. If you include hyphens in the name, you can guarantee that your tag won’t appear in any future versions of HTML.

This is so cool, and I had never heard of this before. I wonder why this is not more popular — really semantic HTML!
