This is a good post to share with anyone who is still sceptical about agentic engineering. [Mitchell Hashimoto](https://mitchellh.com/) (creator of Vagrant, co-founder of HashiCorp, now building [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/)) goes through his journey from "this isn't really helpful at all" to "it consistently adds value."

> Instead of giving up, I forced myself to reproduce all my manual commits with agentic ones. I literally did the work twice. I'd do the work manually, and then I'd fight an agent to produce identical results in terms of quality and function (without it being able to see my manual solution, of course).

> This was excruciating, because it got in the way of simply getting things done. But I've been around the block with non-AI tools enough to know that friction is natural, and I can't come to a firm, defensible conclusion without exhausting my efforts.

What's noteworthy is that it doesn't happen naturally for Mitchell — he had to put in explicit effort into making this work and he didn't give up when it wasn't working all too well. That may be the big difference between those who are excited about agentic engineering vs not.
