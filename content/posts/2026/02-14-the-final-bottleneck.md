Armin Ronacher:

> I too am the bottleneck now. But you know what? Two years ago, I too was the bottleneck. I was the bottleneck all along. The machine did not really change that. And for as long as I carry responsibilities and am accountable, this will remain true. If we manage to push accountability upwards, it might change, but so far, how that would happen is not clear.

I too am the bottleneck. And I'm glad I am. When I stop being the bottleneck, I'm no longer involved at all. And if I'm not involved, it doesn't matter to me.

A very good and thought-provoking read.
