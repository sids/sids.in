New term added to my vocab that I'm going to use a lot: "feedback loopable".

Lewis Metcalf:

> Agents are most powerful when they can validate their work against reality. When they have *feedback loops*. The problem is, some work is hard to organize in a way that an agent can easily get feedback. The software we build and the tools we use are built for humans. Humans with eyeballs and hands and fingers.
>
> This article is about how to make those problems easier for agents. It's a way to create an environment for your agents so that they can solve problems on their own, and so that you (the human) can intuitively guide them without getting in the way.
>
> This process of building something for humans using methods built for agents is what I call: making it *feedback loopable*.
