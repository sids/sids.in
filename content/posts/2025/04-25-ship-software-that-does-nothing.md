Kerrick Long:

> Many people will tell you to ship a minimum viable product. Others say to ship a prototype to get feedback. Not me. I think you should ship a blank page to your production servers on day one.

> Notice how much is involved in shipping software that does nothing. This work will come around eventually. The later you do it, the riskier it is.

Not satire. Good food for thought.
