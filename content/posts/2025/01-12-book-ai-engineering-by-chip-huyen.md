From the book's Preface:

> This book provides a framework for adapting foundation models, which include both large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs), to specific applications.
> 
> There are many different ways to build an application. This book outlines various solutions and also raises questions you can ask to evaluate the best solution for your needs.

I picked up this book after reading its preface (through the free sample on Amazon). I’m excited to work through it over the next few weeks.

Although we can learn a lot of the stuff from the book by digging through free resources online, I find the way a book is organized super helpful. It pulls everything together, letting me explore the topics both broadly and deeply without getting lost.
