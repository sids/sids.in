> It is not the end of programming. _It is the end of programming as we know it today_. That is not new. The first programmers connected physical circuits to perform each calculation. They were succeeded by programmers writing machine instructions as binary code to be input one bit at a time by flipping switches on the front of a computer. Assembly language programming then put an end to that. It lets a programmer use a human-like language to tell the computer to move data to locations in memory and perform calculations on it. Then, development of even higher-level compiled languages like Fortran, COBOL, and their successors C, C++, and Java meant that most programmers no longer wrote assembly code. Instead, they could express their wishes to the computer using higher level abstractions.

> Eventually, interpreted languages, which are much easier to debug, became the norm.

> BASIC, one of the first of these to hit the big time, was at first seen as a toy, but soon proved to be the wave of the future. Programming became accessible to kids and garage entrepreneurs, not just the back office priesthood at large companies and government agencies.

The above is the central thesis of the article, and I strongly agree with it. The article also explores many more angles on the impact of AI coding, mostly through quoting and referencing others; I agree with some of these perspectives, whilst not so much with others. Nevertheless, it’s quite thought-provoking.
