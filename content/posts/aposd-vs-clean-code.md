> _This document is the result of a series of discussions, some online and some in person, held between Robert "Uncle Bob" Martin and John Ousterhout between September 2024 and February 2025._

John is the author of the book A Philosophy of Software Design (APOSD), a book that was first published in 2018. This book has been on my “to read” list for a while now—I’ve heard very good reviews for it from a lot of people.

“Uncle Bob” Martin and his 2008 book Clean Code of course need no introduction. Clean Code is one of the OG books on modern programming[^1].

This is an open debate between the two authors on the ideas they disagree on. And—wow, wow, wow—what a fantastic debate this is! The quality and depth of discussion is great, they both pull all the punches without holding back, and yet they are very civil throughout. I have never seen anything like this.

I mostly side with John in this debate. While I found many ideas in Clean Code to be very good—especially when I read it many many years ago as a young engineer, I’ve over time felt that it’s too dogmatic and not all that pragmatic.

This is a long read, but it’s well worth your time if you tend to geek out on the nuances of programming and low-level design.

[^1]: The Pragmatic Programmer & Code Complete being the other two books I consider in this league. Many consider Refactoring also to be part of this elite club, but I haven’t read it myself.
