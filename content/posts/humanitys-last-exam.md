[Humanity’s Last Exam](https://agi.safe.ai/)

> Benchmarks are important tools for tracking the rapid advancements in large language model (LLM) capabilities. However, benchmarks are not keeping pace in difficulty: LLMs now achieve over 90% accuracy on popular benchmarks like MMLU, limiting informed measurement of state-of-the-art LLM capabilities. In response, we introduce Humanity's Last Exam, a multi-modal benchmark at the frontier of human knowledge, designed to be the final closed-ended academic benchmark of its kind with broad subject coverage. The dataset consists of 3,000challenging questions across over a hundred subjects. We publicly release these questions, while maintaining a private test set of held out questions to assess model overfitting.

The sample questions are fun to go through, as a way of understanding the level of expertise these models are going to end up at, eventually. _Eventually_  is the keyword there — even the best frontier models do very poorly on this benchmark right now.
