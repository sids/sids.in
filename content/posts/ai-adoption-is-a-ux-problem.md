Nan Yu:

> These tools are casually dismissed as “GPT wrappers” by some industry commentators — after all, ChatGPT (or Sonnet or Gemini or Llama or Deepseek) is doing all the “real work”, right?
> 
> People who take this perspective seem to be throwing away all the lessons we’ve learned about software distribution. It’s like they saw Instagram and waived it off as an “ImageMagick wrapper”… or Dropbox as an “[rsync wrapper](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8863 "Hacker News | My YC app: Dropbox - Throw away your USB drive")”.
> 
> Those products won because they made powerful, highly technical tools accessible through thoughtful design. The biggest barrier to mass AI adoption is not capability or intelligence; we have those in spades. It’s UX.

Amen.
