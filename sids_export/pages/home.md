👋🏽 Hi, I’m _Siddhartha Reddy Kothakapu_, known to most as **Sid**.

I’m a **Software Engineer** with interest in (consumer) **_product_** _development_, _system_ **_design/architecture_** , _programming languages_ (currently: **Kotlin** & **Swift** ), and _engineering_ **_culture_**.

I also have an outside interest in – in no particular order – home automaton, tech company strategy, emerging technologies (especially) in machine learning, productivity, product design, cognitive biases, mental models and other frameworks for thinking, photography (I’m a Nikon guy), cricket, tennis, Formula 1.

I presently _head engineering_&nbsp;at **udaan** (India’s largest B2B e-commerce platform) which I joined as a member of the founding team in 2016. Before this, I was a _Principal Architect_ at **Flipkart** (India’s largest e-commerce platform) which I joined as an early employee in 2010. I was an Engineer at Ziva Software, building Zook.in mobile search engine (before the modern smartphone era of mobile), which I joined straight out of college as its first employee in 2006. As you might have noticed, I’ve been _serial early startup employee_.

I have a master’s degree in Computer Science from [**iiit-b**](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/). My research and thesis was in the field of Information Retrieval.

These days, you can find me lurking on [**Threads**](https://www.threads.net/@sidsr),&nbsp;[**Mastodon**](https://mstdn.social/@sids), [**Bluesky**](https://bsky.app/profile/sids.in),&nbsp;[**X/Twitter**](https://twitter.com/sids)&nbsp;(in that order). You can also connect with me on [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sidsr).
