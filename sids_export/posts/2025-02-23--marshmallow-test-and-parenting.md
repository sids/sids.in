[Marshmallow Test and Parenting by @desunit (Sergey Bogdanov)](https://desunit.com/blog/marshmallow-test-and-parenting/)

> The marshmallow experiment is famous: a little kid in a room staring at a marshmallow. If they wait 15 minutes, they get two marshmallows instead of just one. Some kids would poke the marshmallow, lick it, or just gobble it up. Others found clever ways to distract themselves – singing, closing their eyes, even falling asleep. The results – children who waited supposedly went on to achieve higher scores in school and better life outcomes. The message was clear: if you can delay gratification, you’re set for life. _But later studies revealed some serious holes in that conclusion._

Emphasis mine. The rest of the post is about the myriad of ways that the original conclusion was wrong. Easy read.
